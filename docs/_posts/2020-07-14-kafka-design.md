    Kafka is not a message broker.
    However, it can be used as such very effectively.
    Instead, I'd like to think about as a very peculiar database.
    A database where inserts are insanely fast and sequential reads are preferred and very fast as well.
    Also there is very little support for deleting and updating data. In this episode I am focusing on the architecture and internals of Kafka.
    The best way to understand Kafka is by examining how it works.
