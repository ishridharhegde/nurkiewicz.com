Instead this publication covers thoroughly pretty much every aspect of Java EE you might encounter on a daily basis:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)</li><li>JPA (Java Persistence API)</li><li>EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans)</li><li>JTA (Java Transaction API)</li><li>JMS (Java Message Service)</li><li>SOAP/REST/XML/JSON processing</li><li>JSF (JavaServer Faces)</li><li>...and even more</li></ul>As you can see the book covers all the layers from back-end to API and front-end development. Moreover due to solid size of the publication each of these subjects is treated with care. Expect plenty of end-to-end examples including maven configuration. Sometimes the author goes a little bit too far explaining the history of each technology, how it was evolving and by what was it influenced. Useless in my opinion but luckily such sections ("<i>A Brief History Of...</i>") are clearly separated, thus easy to skip. Moreover some may find these boxes interesting in a way.<br /><br /><br />This is the kind of publication that you will definitely not read from cover to cover but instead go back many times, cherry-picking technologies and details you want study. For example JPA is explained throughout as many as three chapters, I believe almost every annotation is described with concise example. <br /><br /><br />Being Kindle user I was rather disappointed with the quality of electronic edition. Page breaks in weird places, missing bullet points, unusual fonts. Luckily besides that I did not encountered any major shortcomings. I found few slightly broken code samples (mainly syntax errors), probably unavoidable in such a big book (?)<br /><br /><br />At times I was left alone with nagging questions. The author says that "<i>[...] events in CDI are not treated asynchronously</i>" - this begs a questions – how to make them asynchronous, is it possible? When I read that "<i>Bean Validation is available for both server-side applications as well as [...] Swing, Android</i>" - I kept asking myself – what about client-side, JavaScript? Similarly when there are two almost identical code samples, one with <code>@Resource</code> and another with <code>@Inject</code> annotations, a word of explanation what's the difference would be appreciated. Finally, suggesting pre-populating database globally before all tests is controversial. Some find this to be a poor practice since the test relies on data set up somewhere else, outside the actual test scenario, thus making them harder to maintain.<br /><br /><br />The language is understandable and pleasant to read. I was a bit uncomfortable though with the term "<i>configuration by exception</i>" used instead of more popular (?) "<i>convention over configuration<i>" - not to mention the word "</i>exception</i>" is a bit misleading. I didn't found any grammar issues, maybe except awkward looking "<i>Constraint annotations are just regular annotations, so they must define meta-annotations</i>" sentence.<br /><br /><br />I can honestly recommend this book to anyone from Java EE novice (as a general learning resource) to intermediate developers – to serve as a reference. It is not a quick and dirty tutorial but a comprehensive guide that will help you for years.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
