    Typically, more than one developer is working on the same codebase.
    How do they share their work?
    The simplest approach is a common Dropbox folder.
    This has several drawbacks, mainly we risk breaking other's work with our half-done features.
    So we come up with version control systems.
    There we only commit code when all changes are done.
